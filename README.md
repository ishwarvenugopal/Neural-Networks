# Neural-Networks
Programs developed in C++ as part of CE889:Neural Networks and Deep Learning at the University of Essex

This program aims to create a feed-forward neural network with back-propagation to train a mobile robot to follow a left-edge following behaviour.

#### Check Neural_Networks_Report.pdf for a detailed description and analyis of the problem 

Source.cpp : Train a neural network based on a dataset of previously recorded measurements
Source1.cpp : Run the trained neural network on a mobile robot in real-time
